Python Implementation of Different Algorithms

Modules Implemented 
--------------------

1. ANN

    I did this a few years ago as a toy example.

2. k-means

    Do you know how many k-means algorithms there are? (This is just out of my memory now)

        Innovation can come in the following different aspects of the algorithm, making it faster, more robust, etc..

            1. initial value

                kmeans++, vanila kmeans
                initialization with membership, initialization with centroids

            2. distance function

	            Euclidean distance (numerical data), un-similarity (categorical data), hybrid of Euclidean distance and un-similarity (numerical data + categorical data, (a*N + b*U)/(a+b) ), and other distance metrics

	        3. cost function

		        max, or harmonic function (which is differentiable)

	        4. membership assignment

		        hard, soft

	        5. centroid calculation

		        mean, mode, median

		    6. search/optimization

			    it is always local optimal but should be darn close. 

3. optimization

    steps, planned search, ...
